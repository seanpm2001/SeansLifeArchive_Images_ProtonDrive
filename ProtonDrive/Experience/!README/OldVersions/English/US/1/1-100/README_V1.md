# My experience with ProtonDrive

I started using ProtonDrive on 2022 April 7th. It came at a very convenient time, as I had been given early access to the site just a couple weeks before my phones SIM tray was completely destroyed due to taking the SD card out too many times.

I have gone through several file services to the point where they refuse to let me upload OR download. Previously, I tried the following file services:

1. Google Drive (lasted ~2-3 years)
2. Microsoft OneDrive (lasted ~6 months)
3. Dropbox (lasted ~1 month)
4. DeGoo (lasted ~2 weeks)
5. pCloud (lasted ~3 months, still use for some purposes)
6. MediaFire (lasted ~1 week)

This is my 7th file service. I am hoping it can last. Since I was given early access, I hope to get close with a developer, so I can fix problems as they occur, instead of going to another service (which isn't doable, because look at the bad options left)

1. AA. Amazon Drive (not doable)
2. AB. Yandex (not doable)

## Week 1

2022 April 7th -> 2022 April 13th

The service worked fine for the first week, but had some problems that are still affecting me in the present.

## Week 2

2022 April 14th -> 2022 April 20th

The service is still functional, and is being used daily.

## Week 3

2022 April 21st -> 2022 April 27th

The service is still functional, and is being used daily.

## Week 4

2022 April 28th -> 2022 May 3rd

Coming soon

## Problems

### Low storage space

I used to have 500 megabytes of space on my account, but I took advantage of an offer, and increased it to 1 gigabyte, which still really isn't that much. It is the least amount of free space provided by any file service I have ever used.

### Bad downloading method

ProtonDrive for desktop has a really inefficient way of downloading. Instead of streaming to a `*.part` file, it downloads the file into RAM, and uses immense amount of memory, then it spikes upon moving from RAM to disk (sometimes this spike can cause the page or the browser to crash, and max out memory usage, without even downloading the file)

This is a major problem. I can't download files larger than 400 megabytes, as my computer will crash. Just downloading a 350 megabyte file can make my RAM usage jump to 7.3 GiB, and make my SWAP usage go from 0 bytes to 2 GiB instantly. So I have to partition large files before I upload.

### Random download fails

Although uncommon, a download can fail halfway through without a reason.

## Limitations

* You can only upload 5 files/folders at once

* You have very little free storage space (500-1000 MB)
